## Orange and Date Cake

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2/3 teaspoon salt
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup stoned dates
- The grated rind of one orange
- 1 3/4 cups pastry flour

### Instructions
Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, yolks
and whites beaten together, then dates, orange rind and

a moderate oven—about 350°F. When cool, fill and frost.

## Filling and Frosting for Orange and Date Cake
### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar
- The grated rind of half an orange
- Strained juice of one orange
- 1/2 cup dates
- Orange sections and dates for decorating

### Instructions
Sift confectioner's sugar, add grated orange rind and moisten with orange juice. If orange is a very large one 
entire juice may not be needed. On the other hand, if orange is small a little water may be needed to moisten frosting sufficiently. 

To one-half of this mixture add dates, cut into small pieces, and use as filling for cake; frosting with the
remaining mixture and decorating with sections of orange and perfect dates.
